## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's enquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the enquiries)
- **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design

## My process

-Since I basically learned HTML and CSS from scratch to do this I dove straight into it and it was rough. But it turns out that it's always rough and I learned a lot by failing.
A lot.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Everything in SCSS, including partials

### What I learned

-Essentially all of HTML and CSS

### Continued development

-I'm still not fully comfortable with using SVGs and some of the mroe advanced features of SCSS
-I want to become more proficient at React

### Useful resources

- I think that a lot of CoderCoder's stuff on YouTube is pretty helpful with getting to understand SCSS
- Fireship on YouTube
